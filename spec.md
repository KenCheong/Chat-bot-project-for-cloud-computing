We are going to design a LINE chatbot.


## Features

1.Query about summary of news in consideration of coronavirus.
  
  News may cover: How many new confirmed cases today or in certain date; how many cases of new recovery or what's the recovery rate right now. With data of this pubilc will have a basic understanding about what is going on right now.
  
  Moreover, we may capture some information about how many new confirmed cases worldwide. As we know the coronavirus spread fast in China. But it seems to start spreading increasingly in some other countries to which people who contains coronavirus travel. Gathering these information will remind conrovirus for people who want to travel these countries. 

2.Query about FAQ(frequently asked questions) of coronavirus diseases.

When the user try to query some FAQ, the chat bot will display a set of question about coronavirus diseases. For example, 
How to prevent COVID-19? When the user ask the question, the chatbot will display the answer. All FAQ and corresponding answers will be collected from government or WHO pages to guarantee they are trustworthy.

If there are two many FAQ, we may allow users to type in some keywords for question searching. Say, if the user type in 'mask', the chatbot will show 'What is the function of mask?'.

To extend this feature, we may use google API as external service for expanding answers.
